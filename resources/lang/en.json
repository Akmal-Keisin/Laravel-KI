However, using his magic to manipulate time and space at will with a forbidden spell that is considered the most dangerous has opened the door to a mysterious madness called \"the Multiverse.\" To restore a world where everything is changing, Strange seeks help from his ally Wong, the Sorcerer Supreme, and the Avengersâ€™ most powerful Scarlet Witch, Wanda. But a terrible threat looms over humanity and the entire universe that no longer can be done by their power alone. Even more surprising, the greatest threat in the universe looks exactly like Doctor Strange."
